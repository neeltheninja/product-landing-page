            <h1>Types of Keycaps to Choose From</h1>
            <div class="pair">
                <h2>OEM Keycaps:</h2>
                <img src="./images/oem.webp" alt="oem keycaps" class="section-two-images">
                <p class="description">These are the standard keycaps that come with most mechanical keyboards. They are usually made of ABS plastic, which is smooth and shiny, but can wear out over time. They have a medium height and a slight curve on the top surface. They are compatible with most keyboards and switches.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pair">
                <h2>Cherry Keycaps:</h2>    
                <img src="./images/cherry.webp" alt="cherry keycaps" class="section-two-images">
                <p class="description">These are similar to OEM keycaps, but slightly lower and flatter. They are named after Cherry MX switches, which are the most common type of mechanical switches. They are also made of ABS plastic, but some versions are made of PBT plastic, which is more durable and resistant to shine. They have a simple and elegant look that suits many keyboards.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pair">
                <h2>SA Keycaps:</h2>
                <img src="./images/sa.webp" alt="sa keycaps" class="section-two-images">
                <p class="description">These are tall and sculpted keycaps that have a spherical top surface. They are inspired by vintage keyboards from the 1970s and 1980s. They are usually made of thick ABS plastic, but some versions are made of PBT plastic. They have a retro and nostalgic feel that adds character to your keyboard. However, they can be uncomfortable for some people due to their height and angle.</p>

They are usually made of PBT plastic, which gives them a textured and matte finish. They have a minimalist and modern look that works well with compact keyboards. They are also easy to swap and rearrange due to their uniformity.</p>
